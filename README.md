## Project 1: [Retail Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/ltiongl/data-analytics-portfolio-projects/tree/main/retail-sales)

This project analyses the retail sales data from `2022-01-01` to `2024-01-01`, focusing on four key areas:
* `Marketing analysis`: evaluating the effectiveness of marketing spend and discount strategies on sales performance.
* `Seasonal trend analysis`: investigating how holidays and days of the week influence sales.
* `Predictive modeling`: developing and assessing models to forecast future sales revenue.
* `Visualization dashboard`: creating a comprehensive dashboard to present key insights and findings.

The analysis is conducted using both MySQL and Python for data exploration, with a visualization dashboard created to summarize the results.
